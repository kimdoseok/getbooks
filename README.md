# get books
I made a python version of this app last years ago.  I needed to learn other skills than i had already.  I was sulfing on the web and found an it book site.  I tried to download what I wanted but they were a lot.  After a few hours searching and downloading, I decided to make this app.  I was learning golang and made an app with it.  I tried to not use other than basic golang libraries.  Also there were errors of scheduled job on my desktop if I used python version.  I found this was almost perfect running app after I used with Jenkins.  It become really easy to find files with windows search features.   Have fun and enjoy with this app.
